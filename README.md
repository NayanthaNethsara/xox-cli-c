# xox-assignment-c

In this assignment you need to create a C program/s that allows two people to play a variation of
"Tic Tac Toc" with each other.
The rules are simple: Tic Tac Toe is played on an N by N grid. Two players play, one can place
X’s on the board, the other O’s. The player who obtains N X’s (or N O’s) in a row – vertical,
horizontal, or diagonal – wins. The program should be able to handle 3 < N <10
The computer’s job is to keep track of the moves that the players make, inform them if anyone has
won, and prevent them from making incorrect moves. It should first ask player "one" to make a
move, asking for the row and column of where the "X" is to be placed. Then it should do the same
for player "two", placing an "O" in the appropriate row and column. It should alternately ask the
players, checking after each move if a player has won (or if the game is over because there’s no
more room let to place a piece).
In this assignment it is essential to use the following programming concepts learned during the
semester.
• Dynamic memory allocation
• 2D Arrays
• File I/O
• Functions
• Writing header files and using by other programs

Weight: 15% of the module
After each move by a player, the current state of the array should be written to a text file.
The assignment should be well commented so that examiners can easily understand.
